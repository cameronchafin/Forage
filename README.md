# Forage: Mushroom Identification App

Forage is an innovative web application designed for mushroom enthusiasts, foragers, and nature explorers. 
It simplifies the process of identifying various mushroom species using advanced image recognition technology. 
This app aims to provide a seamless and educational experience for its users, enhancing their knowledge about mushrooms and foraging.

## Key Features

### üçÑ Photo Identification
Utilizing the mushroom.id photo regocnition API, Forage allows users to upload photos of mushrooms for instant identification. 
This feature helps in quickly understanding the species and characteristics of the mushrooms encountered during foraging.

## Technology Stack

Forage is built using a combination of modern and robust technologies, ensuring a high-quality user experience:

- **Frontend:** Developed with [Bootstrap](link_to_bootstrap), the frontend of Forage is responsive and user-friendly, providing an intuitive interface that adapts to various devices and screen sizes.

- **Backend:** Powered by [Flask](link_to_flask), Forage's backend handles image processing, data storage, and API interactions seamlessly.

- **Database:** Utilizes [SQLite](link_to_sqlite) for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring quick access to users' collection and identification history.

- **Image Recognition:** Integrates Kindwise's mushroom.id API for quick and accurate photo identification for over 3,100 species of fungi.

## Software Design Process and Approach

Forage was developed using an Agile software development methodology, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability throughout the project lifecycle. The development process was organized into three main sprints, each focusing on a specific set of features and improvements.

### Sprint 1: Identification and Results Functionality
- **Objective:** The primary goal of the first sprint was to establish the core functionality of Forage, which included the ability to identify mushrooms from photos and provide detailed results.
- **Key Achievements:** Developed the photo identification feature using the mushroom.id API, and implemented the detailed results breakdown, providing users with comprehensive information about identified mushrooms.

### Sprint 2: User Authentication and Microservice Integration
- **Objective:** The second sprint focused on enhancing the application's security and user management by integrating a user authentication microservice.
- **Key Achievements:** Successfully connected the application to a user authentication microservice, enabling secure user registration and login functionality.

### Sprint 3: Adding the Collection Feature
- **Objective:** The final sprint aimed to add a personal touch to the application by allowing users to save and manage their identified mushrooms in 'My Collection'.
- **Key Achievements:** Implemented the 'My Collection' feature, where users can save, view, and manage their identified mushrooms, turning Forage into a more personalized experience.

### Agile Principles and Practices
Throughout the development process, the project adhered to key Agile principles, including:
- Regular adaptation to changing requirements.
- Frequent delivery of functional software.
- Emphasis on technical excellence and sustainable development.

This Agile approach ensured that Forage was developed in a responsive and user-focused manner, with each sprint adding significant value and functionality to the application.

## About The Project

Forage was created as a passion project with the goal of merging technology with nature exploration. 
It caters to both amateur and experienced foragers, providing a platform to explore, learn, and engage with the natural world in a safe and informed manner.

As a portfolio piece, Forage demonstrates my ability to harness modern web technologies to create meaningful and user-centric applications.
The project encapsulates my interest in nature, my skills in software development, and my commitment to lifelong learning and environmental education.
